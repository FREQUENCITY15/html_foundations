6 Links and Images

To Create a link in HTML we can use the anchor element.
An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or HTML elect wanted to be a link with an “ <a> “tag

An actor on its own won’t create a functional link however. The anchor element only defines something as the target for a link. The anchor needs an “a href” attribute added for desired functionality.

Href (hyperlink reference) is a value referencing the destination for our link to lead to.

For example

<a href=“https://www.theodinproject.com/about”>click me</a>

<a> tags are anchoring the link definedcby href as “https://www.theodinproject.com/about” to the text click me

Link will appear on txt “click me” and will direct user to theodinprojecty home page.
